Information Retrieval Programming

Usage

After the first run the data should be serialized
and it shouldn't take long at all to load the data.

Once you see 'Enter Query:', you can enter 2 words 
or 2 words and number. If you search 'love her', it 
will find all the instances where the stem of the 
word love and her are right next to each other. If 
you search 'love her 3', it will find all instance 
where the stem of the words love and her are at most
3 words from each other.
